  This time lapse shows the deep neural net learning to detect the cancerous cells in a tissue sample slide. (You may have to wait a moment for the animation to show the learning. Look for grey splotches that change size.)

<h1>Cancer Detection</h1>

<p>
  The human body is a mind-breakingly complicated system, and when something goes wrong it is a notoriously difficult system to debug. Deep learning models such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) are powerful tools for extracting detailed patterns from complex images. In this project, I trained a small CNN on slide images of cells to identify the portions of those images that contained cancerous cells.
